# Cinema Room REST Service with Java

## Project description

You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies. Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!
