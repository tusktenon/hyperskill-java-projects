# Coffee Machine Simulator with Java

See the [project page on Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/33) for a thorough overview.


## Stage 1/6: Make a first cup

### Description

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee â€“ virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink. Throughout the project, you'll learn how to manage ingredients, take user input, and make decisions based on those inputs.

This stage introduces basic console output that represents the process of making a cup of coffee. In the next stages, you will improve the program by adding user interaction and resource management.

### Objective

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. Your task is to simulate the coffee-making process by printing each step to the console, showing what the coffee machine does as it makes the drink.

### Example

Take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

Output:
```text
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
```
