# Fitness Tracker API

## Project Description

You probably have used public APIs in your projects but have you ever wanted to build such an API on your own? If yes, this project is the right place to start. You will create a public API that allows client applications to upload and download data from fitness devices, protect your API with API-Key authentication and apply different rate limit policies to different categories of clients.
