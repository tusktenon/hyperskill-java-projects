# JSON Database with Java 

## *How to run this project*

The JSON Database project actually consists of two programs: a client and a server (that are meant to be run simultaneously in separate terminals). I've written custom Gradle tasks for each of these, so they can be built and run with `gradle runClient`, `gradle runServer`. Alternatively, you can just use `gradle build` to compile all the source files, then navigate to the `build/classes/java/main` directory and run `java client.Main` or `java server.Main`.


## Project Description

Acquire skills of working with JSON to use this tool as part of your work as a software developer. You will create a functional server that exchanges data with a web browser and handles multiple requests.
