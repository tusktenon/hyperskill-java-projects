# Maze Runner (Java)

## Project description

You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies. Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.
