# Hyperskill Java Projects

These are the projects I completed as part of the [Java Backend Developer (Spring Boot)](https://hyperskill.org/courses/12-java-backend-developer-spring-boot) course on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org).

When I started this course, I already had a fair amount of experience with Java, but none with Java build tools. To get as much practice as possible, I decided to use Gradle for even the simplest of projects.
