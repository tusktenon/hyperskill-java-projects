# Task Management System

## Project Description

Have you ever used any task management systems like Jira or Trello? This project is the perfect starting point to build a small yet feature rich application on your own. In this project, you will develop a task management system that allows users to create, update, and manage tasks. You'll implement JWT authentication to protect your system and create aggregate views of tasks. This will give you a good practice in creating advance CRUD applications and provide you with the necessary skills to create a useful web service for your portfolio and daily use.
