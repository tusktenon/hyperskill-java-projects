# Traffic Light Simulator with Java 

See the [project page on Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/288) for a thorough overview.


## Stage 1/6: Open the control panel

### Description

Let's output the starting menu that greets users and shows them a list of four possible options. We will use this menu in later stages.

### Objectives

As a start, develop a simple program that prints six non-empty lines to the output.

1. Being a very polite program, it greets users on the first line with the `Welcome` substring and tells them that they've just started `traffic management system`.
2. The following line is the list's title, with `Menu` substring.
3. After that, finally, display the list line-by-line in exact order, indexing and substrings:
```text
1. Add
2. Delete
3. System
0. Quit
```

In further stages we will control the traffic light system with these actions.

### Example

```text
Welcome to the traffic management system!
Menu:
1. Add
2. Delete
3. System
0. Quit
```
