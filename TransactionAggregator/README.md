# Transaction Aggregator

## Project Description

Backend services often depends on other services to receive necessary data. In this project, you will design and implement a Transaction Aggregator system that demonstrates the fundamentals of inter-service communication using REST APIs. The project will also introduce you to the complexities of dealing with remote server errors, teaching you to build robust systems that can handle unexpected issues gracefully. You will learn how to implement retries to ensure system resilience and continuity of service even when remote servers are temporarily unavailable. Additionally, you'll gain experience in applying caching to optimize system performance and efficiency.
